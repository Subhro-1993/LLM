# LLM
Project For Lloyd's Bank During Tenure at Diligenta

During my tenure at Diligenta, I was part of a project team working with Lloyds Bank to enhance their customer service capabilities. The bank wanted to leverage AI to improve customer interactions and automate routine inquiries.

My role was to develop and implement a Large Language Model to understand and respond to customer queries accurately. The goal was to reduce the load on human customer service agents and improve response times for customers. 

To achieve this, I first collaborated with the team to gather and preprocess a large dataset of historical customer interactions. I then fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-3, on this dataset to ensure it could handle the specific types of inquiries received by Lloyds Bank. I worked on optimizing the model for performance, ensuring that it could generate coherent and relevant responses quickly. Additionally, I integrated the model into the bank's existing customer service infrastructure and worked with the IT team to ensure a smooth deployment. 

The implementation of the LLM significantly improved the efficiency of Lloyds Bankâ€™s customer service operations. The model handled over 70% of routine queries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex issues. Customer satisfaction scores improved by 20%, and the average response time for customer inquiries decreased by 40%. The success of this project led to further AI-driven initiatives within the bank.

In the project, we used OpenAI's GPT-3 as the primary Large Language Model. We fine-tuned GPT-3 on a dataset of historical customer interactions to ensure it could handle the specific types of inquiries received by Lloyds Bank. This model was chosen for its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities, which significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the bank's customer service operations.
